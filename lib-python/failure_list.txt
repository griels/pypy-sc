test_cpickle
    has been re-run, still failing

test_descr
    cannot easily complete this; after another quick review, the failures
    left are mostly "don't care" internal details.

test_builtin
    (some of these might have been fixed by now:)
    - our compilers need to recognize BOM markers
    - eval etc  should accept dict subclasses
    - hex/oct should output '-' for negative numbers
    - FIXED unicode("\u0663", 'raw-unicode-escape') does not work properly
    - disallow interning of string subclasses
    - __future__ import division problems

test_extcall
   cannot be fixed.  PyPy produces different TypeError messages but they are
   also correct and useful (reviewed them again).

test_codecscallback
    Should be fixed by now, takes a long time to re-run

test_compiler 
    not a core mode

test_global
    should be run and pass with --compiler=pyparseapp

test_codeop
    could be fixed, maybe (being worked on)

test_compile
    test_exec_with_general_mapping_for_locals should be modified
    other tests are minor stuff that seem basically fixable, mostly
    missing SyntaxErrors

test_traceback
test_future
test_genexps
    some SyntaxErrors don't come with a lineno attached,
    but ideally we should always produce them.
    A bug in test_genexps is being worked on (assignment to genexps).

test_trace
    Fails because of our compiler generating different linenumber information
    than CPythons.
