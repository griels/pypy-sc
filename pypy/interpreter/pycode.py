"""
PyCode class implementation.

This class is similar to the built-in code objects.
It avoids wrapping existing code object, instead,
it plays its role without exposing real code objects.
SInce in C Python the only way to crate a code object
by somehow call into the builtin compile, we implement
the creation of our code object by defining out own compile,
wich ()at the moment) calls back into the real compile,
hijacks the code object and creates our code object from that.
compile is found in the builtin.py file.
