    Typically this data is shortlived and occuring often in highlevel
    languages like Python. So it would be preferable if we would not need
    to call a malloc function. We can not allocate the data on the stack
    because a global pointer (last_exception_type) is pointing to it.

    Here we use a ringbuffer of fixed size to contain exception instances.
    Our ringbuffer entries have fixed (maximum)size so all malloc over that
    amount are not affected by this code.
    
    warning: this code will not work when your code references
             an exception instance 'long' after it has been raised.
