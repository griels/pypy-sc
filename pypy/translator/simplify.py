    Things we know we can remove:
    1. Basic blocks that do not contain any operations.
       When this happens, we need to replace the preceeding branch with the
       following branch.  Arguments of the following branch should be
       overwritten with the arguments of the preceeding branch, but any
       additional arguments should be kept.
    2. Branches into basic blocks that have a single entry point.
       At this point, we can append all the operations of the following basic
       block to the preceeding basic block (but renaming variables with the
       appropriate arguments.)
