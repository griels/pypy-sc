    ovfcheck_lshift is special because there is no preceding operation.

    ignored. Only exception handlers for the ovfcheck function call
    are taken into account. This gives us the best possible control
    over situations where we want exact contol over certain operations.
    Example:

    try:
        ovfcheck(array1[idx-1] += array2[idx+1])

    assuming two integer arrays, we are only checking the element addition
