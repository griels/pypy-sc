Known RTyper issues
-------------------

Let's list and update here the issues that will show up, or have shown up
already sometime ago, while running translate_pypy::

  * the PBCReprs generally lack a convert_from_to() to convert from a small PBC
    set to a larger one.

  * 'call_args' needs to be implemented in rpbc.py.

  * how to implement the three overrides of translator/ann_override.py ?

  * we get tons of warnings about attributes like 'co_code' that seem to be
    erroneously attached to the base 'Code' class, instead of staying on
    'PyCode'.

  * the pypy trunk is still not annotable.
