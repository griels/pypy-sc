Do now
------

- variables and execution context
- list operations: cons car cdr list
- comparison: = < > eq? eqv?
- lambdas!

Do next
-------

- symbols (should be done with next point)
  - global dict for symbols _obarray_
- (quote <obj>) and '<obj>, not only symbols

- implement key funcions
  (apply, reduce, mapcar and so on)

Do in some future
-----------------

Here starts the real fun!

- macros
- proper tail-recursion
- delayed evaluation
- continuations
