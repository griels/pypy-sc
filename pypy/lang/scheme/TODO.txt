Do now
------

+ evaluate simple expressions like
  (* 6 7) or even (+ 1 2 3 4)
  + parsing is done by some shiny new Carl's thingy
    W_xxx object like W_Fixnum should eval to itself despite context
  = implement basic operations like + * / and so on

-+variables and execution context

+ there is need to distinct identifier from symbol
  (define var 11)
  (symbol? var) -> #f
  (symbol? 'var) -> #t

- control structures
  - boolean

Do next
-------

- symbols (should be done with next point)
  - global dict for symbols _obarray_
- (quote <obj>) and '<obj>, not only symbols

- functions
- implement key funcions
  (apply, reduce, mapcar and so on)

Do in some future
-----------------

Here starts the real fun!

- macros
- proper tail-recursion
- delayed evaluation
- continuations
