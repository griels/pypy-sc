Do now
------

- lambda called with wrong number of args issue

Do next
-------

- implement key functions
  (apply, reduce, mapcar and so on)
  # reduce will not make into python 3.0 ;)

- comparison: < > eq? eqv?

Do in some future
-----------------

Here starts the real fun!

- macros
- continuations
- move syntax checking to parsing
- switch to byte-code generation + eval instead of evaluating AST
