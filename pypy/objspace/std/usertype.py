# XXX we'll worry about the __new__/__init__ distinction later
# XXX NOTE: currently (03-06-21) user-object can only sublass
#   types which register an implementation for 'new' -- currently
#   this means that e.g. subclassing list or str works, subclassing
#   int or float does not -- this is not a bug fixable in userobject
#   (perhaps in the object-space, perhaps in each builtin type...?)
#   but we're documenting it here as there seems no better place!!!
#   The problem is actually that, currently, several types such as
#   int and float just cannot be CALLED -- this needs to be fixed soon.
