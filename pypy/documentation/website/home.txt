PyPy: Implementing Python in Python
=================================== 

The PyPy project aims at producing a simple runtime-system for the Python
language.  We want to express the basic abstractions within the
Python Language itself.  We later want to have a minimal
core which is not written in Python and doesn't need CPython anymore.
We want to take care that technologies such as `Psyco`_ and `Stackless`_
will easily integrate.  Simplicity and Flexibilty are the foremost goals. 
Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is 
nonsense, isn't it?
