Implementing Python in Python
============================= 

The PyPy project aims at producing a simple runtime-system for the Python
language.  We want to express the basic abstractions within the
Python Language itself.  We later want to have a minimal
core which is not written in Python and doesn't need CPython anymore.
We want to take care that technologies such as `Psyco`_ and `Stackless`_
will easily integrate.  Simplicity and Flexibilty are the foremost goals. 
Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is 
nonsense, isn't it?

(May 4th 2005) Next Sprint(s) around EuroPython 2005
===================================================== 

The next sprint is scheduled right after EuroPython 2005 in GÃ¶theborg, Sweden. 
We take a day of break after the conference and do the sprint from 1st-7th 
of July 2005.  Additionally there will be a four day Pre-EuroPython sprint
for people who already are familiar with the PyPy code base. 

(March 28th 2005) Pycon 2005 Sprint in Washington finished
========================================================== 

Our `Pycon 2005 Sprint`_ finished and was a good success.  In our new 
`revision report`_ we track information on compliancy with CPython.  During the 
conferences we made good contacts with other Python implementors and look 
forward to closer cooperation.
