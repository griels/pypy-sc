========================= 

XXX CAUTION: this page does not contain correct information yet 
XXX merge with getting_started somehow? 

There are currently two ways to install PyPy.  If you have a subversion
client we recommend that you just follow the `getting started`_
information on how to checkout and play around. 

Otherwise you can download and unpack one of the following files: 

*pypy-0.6* 
    `pypy-0.6.tar.gz`_ 

    `pypy-0.6.zip`_ 

.. _`pypy-0.6.tar.gz`: http://codespeak.net/download/pypy/pypy-0.6.tar.gz
.. _`pypy-0.6.zip`: http://codespeak.net/download/pypy/pypy-0.6.zip
.. _`getting started`: ../getting_started.html
