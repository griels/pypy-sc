    The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
    implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
    description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
    Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
    nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

EuroPython 2005 sprints finished 
======================================================

We had two sprints around EuroPython, one more internal core
developer one and a public one.  Both sprints were quite
successful.  Regarding the Pre-EuroPython sprint Michael Hudson 
has posted summaries of `day 1`_, `day 2`_ and `day 3`_ on 
the `pypy-dev`_ mailing list.  The larger public sprint 
has not been summarized yet but it went very well.  We had
20 people initially attending to hear the tutorials and 
work a bit.  Later with around 13-14 people we made the
move to Python-2.4.1, integrated the parser, improved 
the LLVM backends and type inference in general.

First PyPy release!
=================== 

We are happy to announce the first public release of PyPy after two years of
spare-time and half a year of EU funded development.  The 0.6 release is
a preview release, concentrating on CPython compatibility, good documentation 
and nice starting points into the PyPy code base.  We invite you to head 
over to the `getting started`_ document or read more in the 
`release announcement`_.  *(05/20/2005)*
