Next Sprint after EuroPython 2005 1st-7th July 
======================================================

The next sprint is scheduled right after EuroPython 2005 in GÃ¶theborg, Sweden. 
We take a day of break after the conference and start sprinting from 1st-7th 
of July 2005.   The sprint theme is likely to be related strongly to 
translation and working towards getting a first self-contained PyPy 
version.  Additionally there will be a four day Pre-EuroPython sprint
for people who already are familiar with the PyPy code base.

Pycon 2005 Sprint in Washington finished
========================================================== 

Our `Pycon 2005 Sprint`_ finished and was a good success.  In our new 
`revision report`_ we track information on compliancy with CPython.  During the 
conferences we made good contacts with other Python implementors and look 
forward to closer cooperation.
