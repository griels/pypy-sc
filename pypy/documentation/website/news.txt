    The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
    implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
    description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
    Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
    nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

First PyPy release!
=================== 

We are happy to announce the first public release of PyPy after two years of
spare-time and half a year of EU funded development.  The 0.6 release is
a preview release, concentrating on CPython compatibility, good documentation 
and nice starting points into the PyPy code base.  We invite you to head 
over to the `getting started`_ document or read more in the 
`release announcement`_.  *(05/20/2005)*

Next Sprint after EuroPython 2005 1st-7th July 
======================================================

The next sprint is scheduled right after EuroPython_ 2005 in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. 
We take a day of break after the conference and start sprinting from 1st-7th 
of July 2005.   The sprint theme is likely to be related strongly to 
`translation`_ and working towards getting a first self-contained PyPy 
version.  Additionally there will be a four day Pre-EuroPython sprint
for people who already are familiar with the PyPy code base.

Pycon 2005 Sprint in Washington finished
========================================================== 

Our `Pycon 2005 Sprint`_ finished and was a good success.  In our new 
`revision report`_ we track information on compliancy with CPython.  During the 
conferences we made good contacts with other Python implementors and look 
forward to closer cooperation.
