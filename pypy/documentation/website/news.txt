    The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
    implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
    description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
    Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
    nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

Heidelberg sprint planning
===========================

The next PyPy sprint will take place at the Heidelberg University
in Germany from 22nd August to 29th August (both days included). 
Its main focus is translation of the whole PyPy interpreter 
to a low level language and reaching 2.4.1 Python compliancy.
The goal of the sprint is to release a first self-contained PyPy-0.7 version.
To learn more see the `Heidelberg sprint announcement`_ or look at
the list of people_ that are expected to come.

PyPy Hildesheim2 sprint ongoing ...
======================================================

Up until 31st August we are in a PyPy sprint at `Trillke-Gut`_. 
Carl has written a `report about day 1`_, Holger 
about `day 2 and day 3`_ and Carl again about `day 4 and day 5`_. 
We also have some `pictures from the sprint`_. 
There has been some great progress already in that we now succeed 
to fully annotate the PyPy code base and have a mode where
we don't borrow object implementations from CPython anymore
(which of course means that we have some modules missing). 
Moreover, there are almost no direct annotation and RTyping 
problems remaining.  Stay tuned.

EuroPython 2005 sprints finished 
======================================================

We had two sprints around EuroPython, one more internal core
developer one and a public one.  Both sprints were quite
successful.  Regarding the Pre-EuroPython sprint Michael Hudson 
has posted summaries of `day 1`_, `day 2`_ and `day 3`_ on 
the `pypy-dev`_ mailing list.  The larger public sprint 
has not been summarized yet but it went very well.  We had
20 people initially attending to hear the tutorials and 
work a bit.  Later with around 13-14 people we made the
move to Python-2.4.1, integrated the parser, improved 
the LLVM backends and type inference in general.

First PyPy release!
=================== 

We are happy to announce the first public release of PyPy after two years of
spare-time and half a year of EU funded development.  The 0.6 release is
a preview release, concentrating on CPython compatibility, good documentation 
and nice starting points into the PyPy code base.  We invite you to head 
over to the `getting started`_ document or read more in the 
`release announcement`_.  *(05/20/2005)*
