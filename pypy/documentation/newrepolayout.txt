===========================================
Proposition: new svn repository layout 
===========================================

Motivation
----------

We want to move to the following structure: 

- `dist`_: source code + documentation (for developer needs) 

- `extradoc`_: talks, papers, newsletters and EU-related information
  that are useful for not-only-developers 

- `eu-tracking`: eu-tracking details that involve internal 
  budget/cost/audit preparations and documentations (not 
  available to anonymous checkouts) 

.. _`extradoc`: http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/extradoc 
.. _`dist`: http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist  

More detailed layout (work in progress) 
---------------------------------------

(starting at /svn/pypy):: 

    branch                  # holds branches 
    tag                     # holds tagged dist-versions

    dist                    # holds current development 
        pypy                # current dist/pypy 
            documentation   # developer documentation (inside pypy!) 
        py                  # and other 'externals' 
        setup.py            # should be there at some point 
        README.txt          # tell how to run PyPy, the translator, tests 
        LICENSE.txt         # copyright notices for tree parts including pypy 

    extradoc                # non-dist documentations (papers etc.pp.) 
        talk                # various pypy-talks 
        paper               # various pypy-related papers (including our own)
        sprint              # sprint related information (reports etc.pp.)
        irclog              # IRC logs (snipped appropriately) 
        eu-info             # legal guidelines/rules partcipation
        eu-forms            # Accession forms (empty) 
        proposal            # several versions 
        newsletter          # ...
        press               # ...
            
    eu-tracking             # strong focus on eu-internal details 
        timesheets          # monthly timesheets 
        monthly-reports 
        deliverables        # deliverable/documents
        minutes             # meeting protocols 
        budget.sxc          
        calendar.sxc 
        ... 
    www                     # website-related stuff (needs its own reconsideration) 


The idea is that developers can use a simple url::
    
    svn co https://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist dist-pypy 

in order to get everything neccessary for sourcecode, documentation
and test development.  Obviously, if you care about the EU-funding 
or web site application/contents you can do an appropriate checkout
as well.  The extradoc contains information interesting to 
developers and other open source projects (seeking funding or not). 

Note, that having documentation inside the source tree will help
with keeping a closer eye on documentation - especially when we 
have special ref-integrity tests for the documentation (which itself
should reference real source-code/functions at some point). For 
example, the refactoring of unitest.py-style tests to `py.test`_ based ones
"forgot" to modify our test-documentation in the too-far-away doc-folder. 
We should move to a scheme where such an omission will raise real 
test errors.
