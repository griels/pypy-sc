PyPy - a Python_ implementation written in Python 
=================================================


.. _Python: http://www.python.org/dev/doc/maint24/ref/ref.html

Here are some good entry points into PyPy's world: 

 * architecture_ gives a complete view of PyPy's basic design. 

 * `getting started`_ provides hands-on instructions 
   including a two-liner to run PyPy on your computer. 

 * coding-guide_ helps you to write code for PyPy. 

 * objspace_ discusses the object space interface 
   and several implementations. 

 * translation_ offers the beginnings of documentation 
   about our low level code generator backends. 

 * recently-modified_ shows a list of recently modified 
   documentation 

 * `compliance test report`_ shows status information 
   about recent runs of CPython's regression tests against PyPy.

----------------------------------

* oscon2003-paper_ is a paper we presented at Oscon 2003 describing 
  what the pypy project is about and why you should care

* An interesting thread on an HP tech report that may be proof the pypy is feasible_ . (We already knew that...)

* An interesting thread on why VHLL rock_ . (We already knew that too.)
	
* A thread on Python in Scheme_ .

* An intriguting project, FlashMob_ - creating an adhoc supercomputer.

* A discussion on Python and lisp_ support

* An interesting repository_ of papers by Xerox Parc members, with quite a few issues more or less relevant to PyPy.

* A thread on the gnu lightning_ project."GNU lightning is a library that generates assembly language code at run-time; it is very fast, making it ideal for Just-In-Time compilers, and it abstracts over the target CPU, as it exposes to the clients a standardized RISC instruction set inspired by the MIPS and SPARC chips."

* A project to create a Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM_) and a PyPy-LLVM_ discussion, and conversation_ between PyPy and LLVM.

* A thread discussing the xhelix_ python C extension implementing Helix encryption and authentication, which may be interesting to use as a pypy performance test at some point.

* A paper for PyCon 2004: "IronPython_ is a new implementation of the Python language targeting the Common Language Runtime (CLR). It compiles python programs into bytecode (IL) that will run on either Microsoft's .NET or the Open Source Mono platform. IronPython includes an interactive interpreter and transparent on-the-fly compilation of source files just like standard Python. In addition, IronPython supports static compilation of Python code to produce static executables (.exe's) that can be run directly or static libraries (.dll's) that can be called from other CLR languages."

* A comparison of Python and Pliant_ , an OS written in a python-like language.
