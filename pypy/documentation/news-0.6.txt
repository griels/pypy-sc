First PyPy release!
=================== 

We are happy to announce the first public release of PyPy after two years of
spare-time and half a year of EU funded development.  The 0.6 release is
a preview release, concentrating on CPython compatibility, good documentation 
and nice starting points into the PyPy code base.  We invite you to head 
over to to the `getting started`_ document or read more in the 
`release announcement`_.  *(05/20/2005)*
