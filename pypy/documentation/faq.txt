How fast is PyPy?

    As of June 2005, PyPy still runs on top of CPython and thus
    is slower by a factor of 2000 compared to CPython.  We don't
    know yet how fast it will be once we complete our translation
    efforts, aimed at a first static self-contained low-level
    translated version.
