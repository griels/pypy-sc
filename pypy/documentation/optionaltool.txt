Optional Tools for running (and hacking) PyPy 
=============================================

In addition to the latest version of svn and Python, we use some optional 
tools to install for working on pypy. They are not required to run all the
tests or to get an interactive PyPy prompt but they help to understand and
debug PyPy. 

Recommended tools:
------------------

* graphviz::

	(used for visualizing the control-flow)
	http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html_

* pygame::

	(to visualize control flow and annotation analysis of python programs)
	http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml_

	- on MAC OSX, TRY THIS::
	Alex will reconstruct the process for us

Optional tools:
---------------

* CLISP::

	Optional (if you want to work on generating lisp code from pypy)
