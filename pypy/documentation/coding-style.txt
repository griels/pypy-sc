Restricted Python
==================

We are writing a Python interpreter in Python, using Python's well known ability 
to step behind the algorithmic problems as language. At first glance, one might 
think this achieves nothing but a better understanding for everybody how the 
interpreter works. This alone would make it worth doing, but we have much larger 
goals. 


CPython vs. PyPy
-------------------

Compared to the CPython implementation, Python takes the role of the C Code. So 
actually, we describe something by Python, which has been coded in C already, 
with all the restrictions that are implied by C. We are not trying to make the 
structures of the CPython interpreter more flexible by rewriting things in C, 
but we want to use Python to give an alternative description of the interpreter.

The clear advantage is that this description is probably shorter and simpler to 
read, and many implementation details vanish. The drawback of this approach is 
that this interpreter will be unbearably slow.

To get to a useful interpreter again, we need to apply some mappings to the 
implementation, later. One rather straight-forward is to do a whole program 
analysis of the PyPy interpreter and create a C source, again. There are many 
other ways, but let's stick with the easiest approach, first.

In order to make a C code generator simple, we restrict ourselves to a subset of 
the Python language, and we adhere to some rules, which make code generation 
obvious and easy.


Restricted Python is Runtime Python
-------------------------------------

Restricted Python describes a runnable Python interpreter implementation. This 
is a quite static object that can be suitably described by RPython. But the 
restrictions do not apply during the startup phase.


PyPy Bootstrap
-------------------

When the PyPy interpreter is started as a CPython program, it can use all of 
CPython for a while, until it reaches runtime. That is, all executable code will 
be executed using the full power of Python.

An example can be found in the implementation, which is quite elegant: For the 
definition of all the opcodes of the Python interpreter, the module dis is 
imported and used. This saves us from adding extra modules to PyPy. The import 
code is run at startup time, and we are allowed to use the CPython builtin 
import function.

When the startup code is done, all resulting objects, functions, code blocks 
etc. must adhere to the runtime restrictions. All initialized modules are 
written out in a persistent manner. Our current idea is to emit a huge C source 
file which contains everything created so far. During this process, a whole 
program analysis is performed, which makes use of the restrictions defined in 
RPython. This enables the code generator to emit efficient replacements for pure 
integer objects, for instance.


RPython Definition
--------------------

It might make sense to define a sub-language of Python called RPython, with the 
restrictions depicted below. This is an evolving topic, and we're just 
collecting things which come up during trying to code the interpreter, so this 
is no language at all, but an arbitrary set of rules, which are about to be 
changed all day.


Object restrictions
-------------------------

We are using

**variables**
  
  the same variable in the same context can receive values of different types, 
  at a possible overhead cost. For example, a variable that can contain a 
  wrapped object or None is efficiently implemented as a PyObject* pointer that 
  can be NULL, but a variable that can contain either an integer or a float must 
  be implemented as a union with a type tag in C.

**constants**
  
  all module globals are considered constants.

**integer, float, string, boolean**
  
  avoid string methods and complex operations like slicing with a step

**tuples**
  
  no variable-length tuples; use them to store or return pairs or n-tuples of 
  values

**lists**
  
  lists are used as an allocated array; list.append() does naive resizing, so as 
  far as possible use list comprehensions (see below).  list.extend() or the +=
  operator are allowed and efficient.  Unless there is really a use case for it,
  repetition is limited to initialization purposes: '[single_value] * length'.

**dicts**
  
  dicts with string keys only (preferrably the kind of strings that are usually
  interned in CPython, i.e. short strings that look like identifiers).  The
  implementation could safely decide that all dict keys should be interned.

**control structures**
  
  all allowed

**list comprehensions**
  
  may be used to create allocated, initialized array. the array size must be 
  computable in advance, which implies that we don't allow an if clause.

**functions**

+ statically called functions may use defaults and a variable number of 
  arguments (which may be passed as a list instead of a tuple, so write code that 
  does not depend on it being a tuple).

+ dynamic dispatch enforces use of very simple signatures, equal for all 
  functions to be called in that context. At the moment, this occurs in the opcode 
  dispatch, only.

**builtin functions**

  A few builtin functions will be used, while this set is not defined 
  completely, yet. Some builtin functions are special forms:

**range**
  
  does not create an array. It is only allowed in for loops. The step argument 
  must be a constant.

**len**

+ may be used with basic types that have a length. But len is a special form 
  that is recognized by the compiler.

+ If a certain structure is never touched by len, the compiler might save the 
  length field from the underlying structure.

``int, float, ord, chr``... are available as simple conversion functions.

``int, float, str``... have a special meaning as a type inside of isinstance only.

**classes**

+ methods and other class attributes do not change after startup
+ inheritance is supported
+ classes are first-class objects too

**exceptions**

+ fully supported
+ see below for restrictions on exceptions raised by built-in operations

**objects**

  wrapped objects are borrowed from the object space. Just like in CPython, code 
  that needs e.g. a dictionary can use a wrapped dict and the object space 
  operations on it.

This layout makes the number of types to take care about quite limited.


Example: Integer Types
-------------------------

While implementing the integer type, I (Chris) stumbled over the problem, that 
integers are quite in flux in CPython right now. Depending on the version, 
integers either raise an overflow exception or mutate into longs on overflow. 
Also, shifting right now truncates (up to 2.3) but is going to extend to longs 
as well. In order to enable us to run the restricted Python stuff in CPython, I 
needed to use a derived class r_int(int), which always behaves the same: Never 
leaving its domain, but always staying an integer.

The r_int type is implemented in a pervasive way: Every operation that involves 
an r_int creates an r_int as the result. Therefore, the implementation is not 
cluttered with special type casts. Just the initial value of an emulated 
integer's intval field is initialized by obj.intval = r_int(val) . This way, the 
r_int type propagates itself through all operations without extra effort of the 
programmer.

This concept looks promising, and since we will need unsigned integers which do 
not overflow as well, I also created r_uint. It is always a word-sized unsigned 
integer and never overflows. This will be a building block for things like 
computing hash values, where wrap-around effects are intended and should be 
easily coded without lots of explicit mask shuffling. 

Now I think to extend this even more and build a full set of primitive types, 
which are intended to

+ define the semantics of the primitive type
+ give a working implementation for unrestricted Python

These primitive types can later easily be augmented with methods to emit C code instead of executing. I guess this would be implemented in an extra ObjectSpace.


Exception rules
---------------------

Exceptions are by default not generated for simple cases.::

    #!/usr/bin/python

        x = 5
        x = x + 1    # this code is not checked for overflow

        try:
            x = x + y
        except OverflowError:
            # implement using longs


Code with no exception handlers does not raise exceptions. By supplying an 
exception handler, you ask for error checking. Without, you assure the system 
that the operation cannot overflow.

Exceptions explicitly raised will always be generated.

PyPy is debuggable on top of CPython 
------------------------------------ 

PyPy has the advantage that it is runnable on standard
CPython.  That means, we can run all of PyPy with all exception
handling enabled, so we might catch cases where we failed to
adhere to our implicit assertions.

Naming and development conventions 
================================== 

Naming
------

- directories/modules/namespaces are always **lowercase**

- classes are **CamelCase**

- never use plural names in directory and file names

- ``__init__.py`` is always empty except for ``"pypy/objspace/*"``

- functions/methods are lowercase and ``'_'-separated`` (if
  you need to separate at all)

- not more than 4 directory nesting levels

- it's appreciated if you manage to name files in a directory
  so that tab-completion on the shell level is as easy as possible. 

- objectspace classes are always spelled "ObjSpace". e.g.

  - StdObjSpace
  - FlowObjSpace

- at interpreter level and in ObjSpace all boxed values
  have a leading ``w_`` to indicate "wrapped values".  This
  includes w_self.  Don't use ``w_`` in application level
  python only code.


Committing
----------

- it's nice to write good log messages because several people
  are reading the diffs. 

- if you add (text/py) files to the repository then please run
  pypy/tool/fixeol in that directory.  This will make sure 
  that the property 'svn:eol-style' is set to native which 
  allows checkin/checkout in native line-ending format.


Test Design
=============

Our tests are based on the new `py.test`_ tool which lets you write
unittests without boilerplate.  All tests of modules
in a directory usually reside in a subdirectory **test**.  There are
basically two types of unit tests:

- **Interpreter Level tests**. They run at the same level as PyPy's
  interpreter.

- **Application Level tests**. They run at application level which means
  that they look like straight python code but they are interpreted by PyPy.

Both types of tests need an objectspace they can run with (the interpreter
dispatches operations on objects to an objectspace).  If you run a test you
can usually give the '-o' switch to select an object space.  E.g. '-o thunk' 
will select the thunk object space. The default is the "Standard Object Space" 
which aims to implement unmodified Python semantics. 

.. _`py.test`: http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html 

Writing a test
--------------

Currently the best reference is to go to some test files and look how they are done.

Command line tool test_all
--------------------------

You can run almost all of PyPy's tests by invoking::

  python test_all.py

For switches to modify test execution invoke "python test_all.py -h".

Test conventions
----------------

- adding features usually requires adding appropriate tests. 
  (It often even makes sense to first write the tests so that you are
  sure that they actually can fail.) 

- All over the pypy source code there are test/ directories 
  which contain unittests.  Such scripts can usually be executed
  directly or are collectively run by pypy/test_all.py 

- each test directory needs a copy of pypy/tool/autopath.py which
  upon import will make sure that sys.path contains the directory
  where 'pypy' is in. 

PyPy Documentation
==================

Adding documentation 
-------------------- 

Please add new or updated documentation by checking it in to the appropriate 
directory in subversion, usually under 
http://codespeak.net/svn/pypy/dist/pypy/documentation 

+ Remember to run ``svn up`` **before** doing any commit.
+ All filenames should be lowercase, and documentation should be .txt files.
+ Mark-up the documentation with reST so it can generate a pretty html version.
+ On the server side a commit on the doc-subtree will immediately update the webpage. 

*Note*  If you don't markup the textfile, it'll still be checked in, but when docutils 
runs the parser, it'll look ugly on the website. So run docutils yourself before you commit it. 

Some reST basics:
-----------------

There should be a title on your page. Do it like this::

 Here is my Title
 ==================

 Here is a section title
 -------------------------

Make sure you have a blank line after your = or - lines or it will give you an error.
For marking a block of code so it'll look right, you can::

 Put a line of text ending with ::
  indent your code at least one space
  my code
    more code
      even more code
  still more code

End of the "block" occurs whenever you unindent back to the same level as the
text with the ``::`` at the end.

Using an underscore after a word like ``this_`` will make reST think you want a hyperlink.
To avoid that (especially with things like ``wrap_``), you can use the `` back quote ``
to mark it as plain text.

You can get more info on reST markup at http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/rst/quickref.html


Automatically testing documentation changes
------------------------------------------- 

.. _`docutils home page`: 
.. _`docutils`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/ 

We automatically check referential integrity and ReST-conformance.  In order to 
run the tests you need docutils_ installed.  Then go to the local checkout 
of the documentation directory and run the tests:: 

    cd .../pypy/documentation 
    python ../test_all.py 

If you see no failures chances are high that your modifications at least 
don't produce ReST-errors or wron local references.  A side effect of running
the tests is that you have `.html` files in the documentation directory 
which you can point your browser to! 

Additionally, if you also want to check for remote references inside 
the documentation issue:: 

    python ../test_all.py --checkremote 

which will check that remote URLs are reachable.
