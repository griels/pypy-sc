1.  You need to have docutils installed.
2.  docutils/tools/buildhtml.py  converts your ReST .txt files into .html
    files, and complains when your document has errors.
3.  There is one problem.  It converts _every_ .txt to an .html, and there
    is no option to just specify one file.  I get around this problem by
    making a directory and moving my new file there for testing, and then
    moving it back when I am done.  0 Elegance points for that fix ...
