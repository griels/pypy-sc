"""
Basic Concept:
--------------

All concurrency is expressed by some means of coroutines.
This is the lowest possible exposable interface.

A coroutine is a structure that controls a sequence
of continuations in time. It contains a frame object
that is a restartable stack chain. This frame object
is updated on every switch.

The frame can be None. Either the coroutine is not yet
bound, or it is the current coroutine of some costate.
See below. XXX rewrite a definition of these terms.

There is always a notation of a "current" and a "last"
coroutine. Current has no frame and represents the
running program. last is needed to keep track of the
coroutine that receives a new frame chain after a switch.

A costate object holds last and current.
There are different coroutine concepts existing in
parallel, like plain interp-level coroutines and
app-level structures like coroutines, greenlets and
tasklets.
Every concept is associated with its own costate object.
This allows for peaceful co-existence of many concepts.
The type of a switch is determined by the target's costate.
