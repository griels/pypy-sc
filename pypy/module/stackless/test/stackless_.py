    Tasklet Flag Definition
    -----------------------

    blocked:	    The tasklet is either waiting in a channel for
		    writing (1) or reading (-1) or not blocked (0).
		    Maintained by the channel logic. Do not change.

    atomic:	    If true, schedulers will never switch. Driven by
		    the code object or dynamically, see below.

    ignore_nesting: Allows auto-scheduling, even if nesting_level
		    is not zero.

    autoschedule:   The tasklet likes to be auto-scheduled. User driven.

    block_trap:     Debugging aid. Whenever the tasklet would be
		    blocked by a channel, an exception is raised.

    is_zombie:	    This tasklet is almost dead, its deallocation has
		    started. The tasklet *must* die at some time, or the
		    process can never end.

    pending_irq:    If set, an interrupt was issued during an atomic
		    operation, and should be handled when possible.


    Policy for atomic/autoschedule and switching:
    ---------------------------------------------
    A tasklet switch can always be done explicitly by calling schedule().
    Atomic and schedule are concerned with automatic features.

    atomic  autoschedule

	1	any	Neither a scheduler nor a watchdog will
			try to switch this tasklet.

	0	0	The tasklet can be stopped on desire, or it
			can be killed by an exception.

	0	1	Like above, plus auto-scheduling is enabled.

    Default settings:

    All flags are zero by default.
