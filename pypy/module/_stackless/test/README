the 'tests' 'coro1.py', 'stackX.py' will only work with a pypy version that 
has stackless support (translator/goal/translate.py --stackless).

stackless_.py contains an application level proof of concept implementation of 
stackless on top of stackless.coroutine.
This implementation is neither feature complete nor has it any kind of 
exception handling.
