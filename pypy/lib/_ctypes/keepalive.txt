Few rules about ctypes keepalives:

* Ownership: the memory is freed when owner of this memory is deleted.
  Owner is the one who allocated the memory. So if we have:

  a = c_int(3)
  b = c_int.from_address(a._buffer.buffer) # pypy notion of address access

  only a frees memory.

* _objects: each ctypes object has (eventually) _objects dictionary in which
  it simply keeps objects to be kept alive.

* there are (some) rules about when to put stuff in it's objects when
  accessing the fields etc. need to list them here.
