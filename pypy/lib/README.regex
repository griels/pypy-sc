Following files in this directory are related to regular expression
in PyPy: re.py, dumbre.py, plexre.py, sre_adapt.py, sre_parse.py.

re.py contains backend-neutral interfaces and utilities.

re.py imports Pattern class, with signature __init__(self, pattern, flags),
from backends. Pattern class implements methods of _sre.SRE_Pattern,
like match and search.

dumbre.py is a backend that exits as soon as regular expression is met.
plexre.py uses Plex module to implement regular expression. sre_adapt.py
cheats and imports CPython _sre.

Following information is now out-of-date and incorrect:

(fixed in r8876)
Importing CPython _sre doesn't work currently, because C types are not
succesfully faked. The reason seems to be the lack of __dict__. This is
also why we have pure Python random.py from 2.2 in this directory.

(fixed in r8873)
sre_parse.py is patched because it uses deprecated __getslice__ in
a special way, and PyPy fails to interpret it correctly. Delete this
file when this is fixed.
