General
=======

* mark debugging variables to make our code more readable 

* extend the testing mechanisms to specifically allow: 
  - running plain CPython regrtests (including outputtests, 
    unittests, doctests, ...)  
  - running modified CPython regrtests againat CPython 
    as well as against PyPy 
  - running pure app-level py-test style regrtests 
  - running interp-level py-test style regrtests 
  - running doctests with py.test modules 

* review whatever you like 

StdObjSpace
===========

* String formatting is agonizingly slow.

* (documentation) generate a nice dot-graph from the structure of PyPy
