Task: update pypy homepage

Task: add more builtins! (like e.g. 'dir')

Task: fix interpreter-level object introspection from app-level 
      (make dis.dis(dis.dis) goal work as a side effect)

Task: provide an importer that can import packages
      consider PEP 302, new import hooks
      try to write as much as possible in app-level
      how would PyPy import CPython extension when it runs on top of CPython?

Task: slicing with assigments & more small things (finish StdObjSpace review!)
      lst[::-2] = lst2

Task: try tests of CPython in PyPy

Task: generate a nice dot-graph from the structure of PyPy

Task: integrate the code in translator, with a script that can be
      invoked from the command-line to play with sample source code
(Note: partially done with translator.py.)

Task: trash the standard unittest framework/enhance it

Task: complete the list of operations in type inference (annotation.py)

Task: (documentation) remove/retire all web-pages referencing e.g.
      AnnSpace or other deprecated stuff

Task: (documentation) do more and enhance

==========================================================================
New bigger tasks that we don't want to address during the Amsterdam sprint
==========================================================================

* make application-level types work for (1) StdObjSpace types and (2)
  core interpreter objects.

* clear out and do a clean implementation of multimethod delegation.
  The idea is to give 'kinds' to arguments according to their use,
  e.g. 'numeric argument' or 'object whose identity is preserved'.
  A 'kind' encapsulates a set of delegation functions.
