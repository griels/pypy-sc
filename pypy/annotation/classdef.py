# The main purpose of a ClassDef is to collect information about class/instance
# attributes as they are really used.  An Attribute object is stored in the
# most general ClassDef where an attribute of that name is read/written:
#    classdef.attrs = {'attrname': Attribute()}
#
# The following invariants hold:
#
# (A) if an attribute is read/written on an instance of class A, then the
#     classdef of A or a parent class of A has an Attribute object corresponding
#     to that name.
#
# (I) if B is a subclass of A, then they don't have both an Attribute for the
#     same name.  (All information from B's Attribute must be merged into A's.)
#
# Additionally, each ClassDef records an 'attr_sources': it maps attribute
# names to a set of objects that want to provide a constant value for this
# attribute at the level of this class.  The attrsources provide information
# higher in the class hierarchy than concrete Attribute()s.  It is for the case
# where (so far or definitely) the user program only reads/writes the attribute
# at the level of a subclass, but a value for this attribute could possibly
# exist in the parent class or in an instance of a parent class.
#
# The point of not automatically forcing the Attribute instance up to the
# parent class which has a class attribute of the same name is apparent with
# multiple subclasses:
#
#                                    A
#                                 attr=s1
#                                  /   \
#                                 /     \
#                                B       C
#                             attr=s2  attr=s3
#
# In this case, as long as 'attr' is only read/written from B or C, the
# Attribute on B says that it can be 's1 or s2', and the Attribute on C says
# it can be 's1 or s3'.  Merging them into a single Attribute on A would give
# the more imprecise 's1 or s2 or s3'.
#
# The following invariant holds:
#
# (II) if a class A has an Attribute, the 'attrsources' for the same name is
#      empty.  It is also empty on all subclasses of A.  (The information goes
#      into the Attribute directly in this case.)
#
# The attrsources have the format {object: classdef}.  For class attributes,
# 'object' is the class in question and 'classdef' its corresponding classdef,
# used for binding methods.  For attribute sources that are prebuilt instances,
# 'classdef' is None.
#
# The following invariant holds:
#
#  (III) for a class A, each attrsource that comes from the class (as opposed to
#        from a prebuilt instance) must be merged into all Attributes of the
#        same name in all subclasses of A, if any.  (Parent class attributes can
#        be visible in reads from instances of subclasses.)

    # NB.  an attribute is readonly if it is a constant class attribute.

    #      instances that have the attribute set will turn off readonly-ness.
