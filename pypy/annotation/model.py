"""
This file defines the 'subset' SomeValue classes.

An instance of a SomeValue class stands for a Python object that has some
known properties, for example that is known to be a list of non-negative
integers.  Each instance can be considered as an object that is only
'partially defined'.  Another point of view is that each instance is a
generic element in some specific subset of the set of all objects.

"""

# Old terminology still in use here and there:
#    SomeValue means one of the SomeXxx classes in this file.
#    Cell is an instance of one of these classes.

# Think about cells as potato-shaped circles in a diagram:
