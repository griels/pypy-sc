pypy-1.0.0: dynamic language translation framework, multi-target Python implementation
=======================================================================================

Welcome to the PyPy 1.0 release - a milestone integrating the
results of 28 months of EU funded research, engineering,
management and sprinting efforts!  

Although still not mature enough for general use, PyPy 1.0 materializes 
for the first time the full extent of our original vision:

- A flexible Python interpreter, written in "RPython": 
  - mostly unaware of threading, memory and lower-level target platform aspects
  - showcases advanced interpreter features and prototypes 
  - passes core CPython regression tests, translates to C, LLVM and .NET 

- An advanced framework to translate such interpreters and programs: 
  - performs whole type-inference on RPython programs 
  - weaves threading, memory and target platform aspects
  - low level (C, LLVM) and high level (CLI, Java, Javascript) backends 

- A **Just-In-Time Compiler Generator** able to **automatically**
  produce "jitted" low-level versions of our Python Interpreter, leading
  to JIT-typical speedups on algorithmic example code! 

Previous releases and particularly 0.99.0 from February already 
highlighted features of our Python implementation and the abilities
of our translation approach but the **new JIT Generator** 
clearly marks a major research result and gives weight to our vision 
that one can generate efficient Interpreter implementations, starting 
from a High Level Language Interpreter description.  

We have prepared several good possibilities to start looking around
or to get started yourself: 

* the main entry point for JIT documentation and status:

* the main documentation and getting-started PyPy entry point: 

  http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/index.html

* our online "play1" demos showcasing various Python
  interpreters, features (and a new way to program 
  AJAX applications): 

  http://play1.pypy.org 

* our detailed and in-depth Reports about various
  aspects of the project, closing up on 28 months of
  research and development:

In the next months, we are going to discuss and aim for the
next stages and goals of development - now more than ever depending 
on your feedback and contributions - and we hope you appreciate 
pypy-1.0 as an interesting basis for greater things to come, 
as much as we do ourselves! 

have fun,

What is PyPy? 
================================

Technically, PyPy is both a Python Interpreter implementation 
and an advanced Compiler, actually a framework for implementing 
dynamic languages and generating virtual machines for them.

The Framework allows for alternative frontends and
for alternative backends, currently C, LLVM and .NET.  
For our main target "C", we can can "mix in" different Garbage
Collectors and threading models, including micro-threads aka
"Stackless".  The inherent complexity that arises from this
ambitious approach is mostly kept away from the Python
interpreter implementation, our main frontend.

PyPy now is also a Just-In-Time compiler generator.  The translation
framework contains the now integrated JIT generation
technology. This works based on hints added to the source interpreter,
it should allow to cope with the changes to the interpreter, and be
generally applicable to other interpreters written using the
framework.

Socially, PyPy is a collaborative effort of many individuals
working together in a distributed and sprint-driven way since
2003.  PyPy would not have gotten as far without the coding,
feedback and general support from numerous people. 

Formally, many of the current developers were involved in executing an
EU contract with the goal of exploring and researching new approaches
to Language/Compiler development and software engineering.  This
contract's duration is about to end this month (March 2007) and we are
working and preparing the according final review which is scheduled
for May 2007.

Key 1.0.0 Features 
=====================

XXX think more carefully about this section 

The 0.99 release from last month lists a lot of highlights
that we are not going to repeat here, please check it out: 

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-0.99.0.html
   
We here just list the new achievements newly exposed with 1.0: 

- the Just-In-Time Compiler Generator 

- more optimizations (CALL_METHOD(+cache), ropes), leading up 
  to having generated Python versions run benchmarks at 
  around half of CPython's speed. 

- CLR module for .NET/CLI integration

- Aspect Oriented Programming (based on amending the Abstract
  Syntax Tree) 


Funding partners and organisations
=====================================================
    
PyPy development and activities happens as an open source project and
with the support of a consortium partially funded by a 28 months
European Union IST research grant for the period December 2004 up to
March 2007. The full partners of that consortium are:
        
    Heinrich-Heine University (Germany), Open End (Sweden)
    merlinux GmbH (Germany), tismerysoft GmbH (Germany) 
    Logilab Paris (France), DFKI GmbH (Germany)
    ChangeMaker (Sweden), Impara (Germany)
