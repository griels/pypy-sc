Use the 'pypymagic' module. 
This module is expected to be working and is included by default.
It contains special (sometimes slightly magic) PyPy-specific functionality.
For example most of the special functions described in the `object space proxies`
document are in the module.

.. _`object space proxy`: ../objspace-proxies.html
