Use stackless to find roots in a framework GC.

Only for framework GCs.  This uses a different method to find the
garbage collection roots on the stack, by unwinding it, using stackless:
:config:`translation.stackless`.

When stacklessgc is not enabled, the default method - which turns out to
be faster for now - is to maintain a custom root stack.
