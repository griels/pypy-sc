normal Python semantics, the others are `Object Space Proxies`_ giving
additional features (except the Flow Object Space which is not intended
for normal usage):

  * thunk_: adds lazy evaluation to Python
  * logic_: logical programming features
  * taint_: soft security
  * dump_:  dump all operations to a log
