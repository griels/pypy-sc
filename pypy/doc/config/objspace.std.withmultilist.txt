This enables "multilists". They are a different implementation of the Python
``list`` type, indistinguishable for the normal user (when using multilists, the
normal implementation is not used at all). When the multilist implementation is
used, a list can change its internal representation over its lifetime. If a list
contains only strings, for example, the strings are stored directly without
their wrapper (which gives a memory benefit on large lists).

Another special representation of lists that multilists support is the "range
list", which is basically equivalent to what `objspace.std.withrangelist`_ does.
