Enable "string slice" objects. They are a different implementation of the Python
``str`` type, indistinguishable for the normal user. They represent the lazy
slicing of a string without actually performing the slicing (which involves
copying). This is only done for slices of step one.  When the actual value of
the string slice object is needed, the slicing is done (although a lot of string
methods don't make this necessary). This makes string slicing a very efficient
operation. It also saves memory in some cases but can also lead to memory leaks,
since the string slice retains a reference to the original string.
