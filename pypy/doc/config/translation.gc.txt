Choose the Garbage Collector used by the translated program:

  - "ref": reference counting. Takes very long to translate and the result is
    slow.

  - "framework": one of our custom garbage collectors. Takes moderately long
    and is the fastest option without external dependencies.  See
    :config:`translation.frameworkgc`.

  - "boehm": use the Boehm conservative GC
