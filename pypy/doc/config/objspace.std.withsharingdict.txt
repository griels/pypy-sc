Enable "sharing dictionaries". They are a special dict representation used
together with `multidicts`_. This dict representation is used only for instance
dictionaries and tries to make instance dictionaries use less memory (in fact,
in the ideal case the memory behaviour should be mostly like that of using
__slots__).

The idea is the following: Most instances of the same class have very similar
attributes. Therefore all the instance dictionaries of these instances all store
the same keys. To save memory, these common keys could be stored in a common
place. This is exactly what "sharing dictionaries" are doing: only the values
themselves are stored on the instance, the rest in a shared structure.
