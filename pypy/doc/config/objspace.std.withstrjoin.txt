Enable "string join" objects. They are a different implementation of the Python
``str`` type, indistinguishable for the normal user. They represent the lazy
addition of several strings without actually performing the addition (which
involves copying etc.). When the actual value of the string join object is
needed, the addition is performed. This makes it possible efficiently perform
string additions in a loop without using the ``"".join(list_of_strings)``
pattern.
