How to use the Logic Object space features of PyPy 0.9
======================================================

Outline
=======

This document gives some information about the content and usage of an
extension of PyPy known as the Logic Objectspace (LO). The LO, when
finished, will provide additional builtins that will allow to write:

* concurrent programs based on coroutines scheduled by dataflow logic
  variables,

* concurrent logic programs,

* concurrent constraint problems,

* new search "engines" to help solve logic/constraint programs.

The 0.9 preview comes without logic programming; the constraint solver
is only lightly tested, is not equipped with some specialized but
important propagators for linear relations on numeric variables, and
*might* support concurrency - but that would be an accident; the
dataflow scheduling of coroutines is known to fail in at least one
basic and important case.

In this document, we skim over these topics, hoping to give enough
information and examples for an uninformed user to understand what is
going on and how to use the provided functionnality.

Logic Variables and Dataflow Synchronisation of Coroutines
==========================================================

Logic Variables
+++++++++++++++

Description and examples
------------------------

Logic variables are (should be, in an ideal LO) similar to Python
variables in the following sense: they map names to values in a
defined scope. But unlike normal Python variables, they have two
states: free and bound. A bound logic variable is indistinguishable
from a normal Python value, which it wraps. A free variable can only
be bound once (it is also said to be a single-assignment variable). It
is good practice to denote these variables with a beginning capital
letter, so as to avoid confusion with normal variables.

The following snippet creates a new logic variable and asserts its
state::

  X = newvar()
  assert is_free(X)
  assert not is_bound(X)

Logic variables can be bound thusly::

  bind(X, 42)
  assert X / 2 == 21

The single-assignment property is easily checked::

  bind(X, 'hello') # would raise a FailureException
  bind(X, 42)      # is admitted (it is a noop)

In the current state of the LO, a generic Exception will be raised.
It is quite obvious from this that logic variables are really objects
acting as boxes for python values. No syntactic extension to Python is
provided yet to lessen this inconvenience.

The bind operator is low-level. The more general operation that binds
a logic variable is known as "unification". Unify is an operator that
takes two arbitrary data structures and tries to assert their
equalness, much in the sense of the == operator, but with one
important twist: unify mutates the state of the involved logic
variables.

Unifying structures devoid of logic variables, like::

  unify([1, 2], [1, 2])
  unify(42, 43)

is equivalent to an assertion about their equalness, the difference
being that a FailureException will be raised instead of an
AssertionError, would the assertion be violated::

  assert [1, 2] == [1, 2]   
  assert 42 == 43           

A basic example involving logic variables embedded into dictionnaries::

  Z, W = newvar(), newvar()
  unify({'a': 42, 'b': Z},
        {'a':  Z, 'b': W})
  assert Z == W == 42

Unifying one unbound variable with some value (a) means assigning the
value to the variable (which then satisfies equalness), unifying two
unbound variables (b) aliases them (they are constrained to reference
the same -future- value). 

Assignment or aliasing of variables is provided underneath by the
'bind' operator.

An example involving custom data types::

  class Foo(object):
      def __init__(self, a):
          self.a = a
          self.b = newvar()

  f1 = Foo(newvar())
  f2 = Foo(42)
  unify(f1, f2)
  assert f1.a == f2.a == 42    # assert (a)
  assert alias_of(f1.b, f2.b)  # assert (b)
  unify(f2.b, 'foo')
  assert f1.b == f2.b == 'foo' # (b) is entailed indeed


The operators table
-------------------

Logic variables support the following operators (with their arity):

Predicates

 is_free/1
   any -> bool

 is_bound/1
   any -> bool

 alias_of/2
   logic vars. -> bool

Variable Creation

 newvar/0
   nothing -> logic variable
 
Mutators

 bind/2
   logic var., any -> None

 unify/2
   any, any -> None


Threads and dataflow synchronisation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Description and examples
------------------------

When a piece of code tries to access a free logic variable, the thread
in which it runs is blocked (suspended) until the variable becomes
bound. This behaviour is known as "dataflow synchronization" and
mimics exactly the dataflow variables from the `Oz programming
language`_. With respect to behaviour under concurrency conditions,
logic variables come with two operators :

* wait: this suspends the current thread until the variable is bound,
  it returns the value otherwise (impl. note: in the logic
  objectspace, all operators make an implicit wait on their arguments)

* wait_needed: this suspends the current thread until the variable
  has received a wait message. It has to be used explicitly,
  typically by a producer thread that wants to produce data only when
  needed.

In this context, binding a variable to a value will make runnable all
threads blocked on this variable.

Wait and wait_needed allow to write efficient lazy evaluating code.

Using the "uthread" builtin (which spawns a coroutine and applies the
2..n args to its first arg), here is how to implement a
producer/consummer scheme::

  def generate(n, limit):
      if n < limit:
          return (n, generate(n + 1, limit))
      return None

  def sum(L, a):
      Head, Tail = newvar(), newvar()
      unify(L, (Head, Tail))
      if Tail != None:
          return sum(Tail, Head + a)
      return a + Head

  X = newvar()
  S = newvar()
        
  unify(S, uthread(sum, X, 0))
  unify(X, uthread(generate, 0, 10))

  assert S == 45

Note that this eagerly generates all elements before the first of them
is consummed. Wait_needed helps us write a lazy version of the
generator. But the consummer will be responsible of the termination,
and thus must be adapted too::

  def lgenerate(n, L):
      """lazy version of generate"""
      wait_needed(L)
      Tail = newvar()
      bind(L, (n, Tail))
      lgenerate(n+1, Tail)

  def lsum(L, a, limit):
      """this summer controls the generator"""
      if limit > 0:
          Head, Tail = newvar(), newvar()
          wait(L)
          unify(L, (Head, Tail))
          return lsum(Tail, a+Head, limit-1)
      else:
          return a

  Y = newvar()
  T = newvar()

  uthread(lgenerate, 0, Y)
  unify(T, uthread(lsum, Y, 0, 10))

  wait(T)
  assert T == 45

Please note that in the current LO, we deal with coroutines, not
threads (thus we can't rely on preemtive scheduling to lessen the
problem with the eager consummer/producer program). Also nested
coroutines don't schedule properly yet. This impacts the ability to
write a simple program like the following::

  def sleep(X, Barrier):
      wait(X)
      bind(Barrier, True)
        
  def wait_two(X, Y):
      Barrier = newvar()
      uthread(sleep, X, Barrier)
      uthread(sleep, Y, Barrier)
      wait(Barrier)
      if is_free(Y):
          return 1
      return 2

  X, Y = newvar(), newvar()
  o = uthread(wait_two, X, Y)
  unify(X, Y)
  unify(Y, 42)
  assert X == Y == 42
  assert o == 2

Finally, it must be noted that the bind/unify and wait pair of
operations are quite similar to the asynchronous send and receive
primitives commonly used for for inter-process communication.

The operators table
-------------------

Blocking ops

 wait/1 # blocks if first arg. is a free logic var., til it becomes bound
   value -> value

 wait_needed/1 # blocks until its arg. receives a wait
   logic var. -> logic var.

 wait_two/2
   logic var., logic var. ->  int in {1,2}

Coroutine spawning

 uthread/n | 1 <= n 
   callable, opt args. -> logic var.


Constraint Programming
======================

The LO comes with a flexible, extensible constraint solver
engine. While regular search strategies such as depth-first or
breadth-first search are provided, you can write better, specialized
strategies (an exemple would be best-search). We therein describe how
to use the solver to specify and get the solutions of a constraint
satisfaction problem, and then highlight how to extend the solver with
new strategies.

Using the constraint engine
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Specification of a problem 
--------------------------

A constraint satisfaction problem is defined by a triple (X, D, C)
where X is a set of finite domain variables, D the set of domains
associated with the variables in X, and C the set of constraints, or
relations, that bind together the variables of X.

Note that the constraint variables are NOT logic variables. Not yet
anyway.

So we basically need a way to declare variables, their domains and
relations; and something to hold these together. The later is what we
call a "computation space". The notion of computation space is broad
enough to encompass constraint and logic programming, but we use it
there only as a box that holds the elements of our constraint
satisfaction problem. Note that it is completely unrelated to the
notion of object space (as in the logic object space).

A problem is a one-argument procedure defined as follows::

  def simple_problem(cs):
      cs.var('x', FiniteDomain(['spam', 'egg', 'ham']))
      cs.var('y', FiniteDomain([3, 4, 5]))

This snippet defines a couple of variables and their domains, on the
'cs' argument which is indeed a computation space. Note that we didn't
take a reference of the created variables. We can query the space to
get these back if needed, and then complete the definition of our
problem. Our problem, continued::

  ... x = cs.find_var('x')
      y = cs.find_var('y')
      cs.tell(make_expression([x,y], 'len(x) == y'))
      
      return x, y
      
We must be careful to return the set of variables whose candidate
values we are interested in. The rest should be sufficiently
self-describing... 

Getting solutions
-----------------

Now to get and print solutions out of this, we must::

  import solver
  cs = newspace()
  cs.define_problem(simple_problem)
  
  for sol in solver.solve(cs):
      print sol

The builtin solve function returns a generator. You will note with
pleasure how slow the search can be on a solver running on a Python
interpreter written in Python, the later running on top of
cpython... It is expected that the compiled version of PyPy + LO will
provide decent performance.

Extending the search engine
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Writing a solver
----------------

Here we show how the additional builtin primitives allow you to write,
in pure Python, a very basic solver that will search depth-first and
return the first found solution.

As we've seen, a CSP is encapsulated into a so-called "computation
space". The space object has additional methods that allow the solver
implementor to drive the search. First, let us see some code driving a
binary depth-first search::

  1   def first_solution_dfs(space):
  2       status = space.ask()
  3       if status == 0:
  4           return None
  5       elif status == 1:
  6           return space.merge()
  7       else:
  8           new_space = space.clone()
  9           space.commit(1)
  10          outcome = first_solution_dfs(space)
  11          if outcome is None:
  13              new_space.commit(2)
  14              outcome = first_solution_dfs(new_space)
  15          return outcome

This recursive solver takes a space as argument, and returns the first
solution or None. Let us examine it piece by piece and discover the
basics of the solver protocol.

The first thing to do is "asking" the space about its status. This may
force the "inside" of the space to check that the values of the
domains are compatibles with the constraints. Every inconsistent value
is removed from the variable domains. This phase is called "constraint
propagation". It is crucial because it prunes as much as possible of
the search space. Then, the call to ask returns a positive integer
value which we call the space status; at this point, all (possibly
concurrent) computations happening inside the space are terminated.

Depending on the status value, either:

* the space is failed (status == 0), which means that there is no
  combination of values of the finite domains that can satisfy the
  constraints,

* one solution has been found (status == 1): there is exactly one
  valuation of the variables that satisfy the constraints,

* several branches of the search space can be taken (status represents
  the exact number of available alternatives, or branches).

Now, we have written this toy solver as if there could be a maximum of
two alternatives. This assumption holds for the simple_problem we
defined above, where a binary "distributor" (see below for an
explanation of this term) has been chosen automatically for us, but
not in the general case. See the sources for a more general-purpose
`solver`_ and more involved `sample problems`_ (currently, probably
only conference_scheduling is up to date with the current API).

In line 8, we take a clone of the space; nothing is shared between
space and newspace (the clone). We now have two identical versions of
the space that we got as parameter. This will allow us to explore the
two alternatives. This step is done, line 9 and 13, with the call to
commit, each time with a different integer value representing the
branch to be taken. The rest should be sufficiently self-describing.

This shows the two important space methods used by a search engine:
ask, which waits for the stability of the space and informs the solver
of its status, and commit, which tells a space which road to take in
case of a fork.

Using distributors
------------------

Now, earlier, we talked of a "distributor": it is a program running in
a computation space. It could be anything, and in fact, in the final
version of the LO, it will be any Python program, augmented with calls
to non-deterministic choice points. Each time a program embedded in a
computation space reaches such a point, it blocks until some Deus ex
machina makes the choice for him. Only a solver can be responsible for
the actual choice (that is the reason for the name "non
deterministic": the decision does not belong to the embedded program,
only to the solver that drives it).

In the case of a CSP, the distributor is a simple piece of code, which
works only after the propagation phase has reached a fixpoint. Its
policy will determine the fanout, or branching factor, of the current
computation space (or node in the abstract search space).

Here are two examples of distribution strategies:

* take the variable with the biggest domain, and remove exactly one
  value from its domain; thus we always get two branches: one with the
  value removed, the other with only this value remaining,

* take a variable with a small domain, and keep only one value in the
  domain for each branch (in other words, we "instantiate" the
  variable); this makes for a branching factor equal to the size of
  the domain of the variable.

There are a great many ways to distribute... Some of them perform
better, depending on the caracteristics of the problem to be
solved. But there is no absolutely better distribution strategy. Note
that the second strategy given as example there is what is used (and
hard-wired) in the MAC algorithm.

Currently in the LO we have two builtin distributors:

* NaiveDistributor, which distributes domains by splitting the
  smallest domain in 2 new domains; the first new domain has a size of
  one, and the second has all the other values,

* SplitDistributor, which distributes domains by splitting the
  smallest domain in N equal parts (or as equal as possible).  If N is
  0, then the smallest domain is split in domains of size 1; a special
  case of this, DichotomyDistributor, for which N == 2, is also
  provided and is the default one.

To explicitly specify a distributor for a constraint problem, you
need to say, in the procedure that defines the problem::

  cs.set_distributor(NaiveDistributor())

It is not possible currently to write distributors in pure Python;
this is scheduled for PyPy version 1.
