Making a PyPy Release
=======================

Overview
---------

As a meta rule setting up issues in the tracker for items here may help not forgetting things.

Check and prioritize all issues for the release, postpone some if necessary,
create new  issues also as necessary. A meeting (or meetings) should be organized
to decide what things are priorities, should go in and work for the release. 
An important thing is to get the documentation into an up-to-date state.

Release Steps
----------------

* at code freeze make a release branch under http://codepeak.net/svn/pypy/release/x.y(.z) ,
  some of the next updates may be done before or after branching;
  make sure things are ported back to the trunk and to the branch as necessary
* XXX find out and list the set  of testing necessary
* update dist/pypy/doc/contributort.txt (and possibly dist/LICENSE)
* update dist/README
* write release announcement dist/pypy/doc/release-x.y(.z).txt
* update the status section in dist/pypy/doc/architecture.txt
* update dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.txt links at the top
  and release number references, make sure it is generally up-to-date
* use, after the necessary updates, dist/pypy/tool/makerealase.py to make the tarballs 
  on codespeak (XXX what about tagging the release?)
* test the download links in dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.txt and possibly in the release announcement,
  ask people to test them
* write a news item for the release in dist/pypy/doc/news.txt
* send announcements to pypy-dev, pypy-funding, python-list, python-announce, python-dev ...
