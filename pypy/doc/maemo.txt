How to run PyPy on top of maemo platform
========================================

This is a short introduction how to install correct environment and
cross-compile pypy to maemo platform emulator under qemu. Note that this
is work-in-progress.

Installing `scratchbox`_
------------------------

I had no success with installing scratchbox 2.0, but theoretically it
should work. Follow these `installation instructions`_,
make sure that you install cpu-transparency modules, otherwise emulation will
not be available. Preferred toolchain is cs2005q3.2-glibc2.5-arm.

Follow instructions, running sb-menu and selecting cpu-transparency
method (qemu-arm), devkits (debian-lenny, cpu-transparency) and install files
(and not a rootstrap).

I had to manually edit /scratchbox/devkits/debian-etch/etc/environment 
to add ARCH=armel, otherwise things did not work

Translating pypy
----------------

Run::
  ./translate.py --platform=maemo --opt=mem targetpypystandalone --no-allworkingmodules

This should create pypy-c which is able to run on top of scratchbox. To run it
you need to copy pypy-c, together with libraries to a place accessible
from inside scratchbox. Default is /scratchbox/users/<user>/home/<user> where
<user> is your user id.
