The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

PyPy Trillke Sprints upcoming, 25-28th Feb and 1-5th March 2007
==================================================================

The end of the EU project period is nearing and we are going
for two sprints, one on particular EU related issues and
one for public coding and discussing the time ahead. 
Read the `full announcement here`_ and `people known to come`_ already.

Massive Parallelism and Translation Aspects
========================================================

Our next big `EU report`_ about Stackless features, optimizations, and
memory management is finished.  You can download it `as pdf`_.

Duesseldorf sprint #2, 30th October - 5th November over
==================================================================

The Duesseldorf sprint is over. It was a very productive sprint with work done
in various areas. Read the `sprint report`_ for a detailed description of what
was achieved and the `full announcement`_ for various details.

Dynamic Languages Symposium (OOPSLA, 23rd October)
==================================================================

We will present a paper at the `Dynamic Languages Symposium`_ describing
`PyPy's approach to virtual machine construction`_.  The DLS is a
one-day forum within OOPSLA'06 (Portland, Oregon, USA).  The paper is a
motivated overview of the annotation/rtyping translation tool-chain,
with experimental results.

As usual, terminology with PyPy is delicate :-)  Indeed, the title is
both correct and misleading - it does not describe "the" PyPy virtual
machine, since we have never hand-written one.  This paper focuses on
how we are generating such VMs, not what they do.

Summer of PyPy: Calls for proposals open now! 
==================================================================

Happily, we are able to offer students mentoring and full sprint
participant's funding if we receive a proposal outlining an
interesting project related to PyPy and its development tools.  This
follows up on the "Summer of Code" campaign from Google but is
completely independent from it and also works differently. 
See the full call for details:

Ireland sprint 21st-27th August 
==================================================================

The last PyPy sprint happened in the nice city of 
Limerick in Ireland from 21st till 27th August.  
The main focus of the sprint was on JIT compiler works, 
various optimization works, porting extension modules, 
infrastructure works like a build tool for PyPy and
extended (distributed) testing. 
Read the full `announcement`_ for more details.

Release of PyPy video documentation
==================================================================

The PyPy team is happy to announce that the first bunch of PyPy videos
can now be downloaded from:

http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/video-index.html

The videos introduce involved people and contain different talks, tutorials and
interviews and can be downloaded via bittorrent. **29th June 2006**

PyPy 0.9.0
==================================================================

We are proud to release PyPy 0.9.0, our fourth public release.  See
the `release announcement <release-0.9.0.html>`__ to read about the
many new features in this release.

PyPy and Summer of Code 2006
==================================================================

PyPy will again mentor students through Google's `Summer of Code`_
campaign. Three students will kick-off their work on PyPy by
participating in the Duesseldorf sprint. They will be exploring a
back-end for Microsoft.NET, work on ways to build web applications
with Javascript code (in this case by translating RPython to
Javascript) and porting some CPython modules to use ctypes. Welcome to
the team!
