The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

PyPy Sprint in Palma De Mallorca 23rd - 29th January 2006
===================================================================

The Mallorca sprint that took place in Palma de Mallorca is over.
Topics included progressing with the JIT work started in Göteborg
and Paris, GC and optimisation work, stackless, and
improving our way to write glue code for C libraries.

Read more in `the announcement`_, there is a `sprint report`_
for the first three days and `one for the rest of the sprint`_.

Preliminary EU reports released
===============================

After many hours of writing and typo-hunting we finally finished the
`reports for the EU`_. They contain most of the material found on our regular
documentation page but also a lot of new material not covered there. Note that
all these documents are not approved by the European Union and therefore only
preliminary. *(01/06/2006)*

PyPy Sprint in Göteborg 7th - 11th December 2005 
=================================================

The Gothenburg sprint is over. It was a very productive sprint: work has
been started on a JIT prototype, we added support for __del__ in PyPy, 
the socket module had some progress, PyPy got faster and work was started to
expose the internals of our parser and bytecode compiler to the user.
Michael and Carl have written a `report about the first half`_ and `one about
the second half`_ of the sprint.  *(12/18/2005)*

PyPy release 0.8.0
=================== 

The third PyPy release is out, with an integrated and translatable
compiler, speed progress, and now the possibility to translate our
experimental "Thunk" object space (supporting lazy computed objects)
with its features preserved.

See the `release 0.8 announcement`_ for further details about the release and
the `getting started`_ document for instructions about downloading it and
trying it out.  There is also a short FAQ_.  *(11/03/2005)*

PyPy Sprint in Paris 10th-16th October 2005 
========================================================

The Paris sprint is over. We are all at home again and more or less exhausted.
The sprint attracted 18 participants and took place in
`Logilab offices in Paris`_. We were happy to have five new 
developers to the PyPy Community! The focus was on implementing
`continuation-passing`_ style (stackless), making the translation process
work for target languages with more powerful object systems and some tiny
steps into the JIT_ direction. Michael and Carl have written
a `report about day one`_ and `one about day two and three`_. 
Together with Armin they wrote one about `the rest of the sprint`_ on the
way back.

PyPy release 0.7.0
=================== 

The first implementation of Python in Python is now also the second
implementation of Python in C :-)

See the `release announcement`_ for further details about the release and
the `getting started`_ document for instructions about downloading it and
trying it out.  We also have the beginning of a FAQ_.  *(08/28/2005)*

PyPy Sprint in Heidelberg 22nd-29th August 2005
==========================================================

The last `PyPy sprint`_ took place at the Heidelberg University
in Germany from 22nd August to 29th August (both days included). 
Its main focus is translation of the whole PyPy interpreter 
to a low level language and reaching 2.4.1 Python compliance.
The goal of the sprint is to release a first self-contained
PyPy-0.7 version.  Carl has written a report about `day 1 - 3`_, 
there are some pictures_ online and a `heidelberg summary report`_
detailing some of the works that led to the successful release 
of `pypy-0.7.0`_!

PyPy Hildesheim2 finished: first self-contained PyPy run! 
===========================================================

Up until 31st August we were in a PyPy sprint at `Trillke-Gut`_. 
Carl has written a `report about day 1`_, Holger 
about `day 2 and day 3`_ and Carl again about `day 4 and day 5`_, 
On `day 6`_ Holger reports the `breakthrough`_: PyPy runs 
on its own! Hurray_!.  And Carl finally reports about the winding
down of `day 7`_ which saw us relaxing, discussing and generally 
having a good time.   You might want to look at the selected 
`pictures from the sprint`_.

EuroPython 2005 sprints finished 
======================================================

We had two sprints around EuroPython, one more internal core
developer one and a public one.  Both sprints were quite
successful.  Regarding the Pre-EuroPython sprint Michael Hudson 
has posted summaries of `day 1`_, `day 2`_ and `day 3`_ on 
the `pypy-dev`_ mailing list.  The larger public sprint 
has not been summarized yet but it went very well.  We had
20 people initially attending to hear the tutorials and 
work a bit.  Later with around 13-14 people we made the
move to Python-2.4.1, integrated the parser, improved 
the LLVM backends and type inference in general.
