The PyPy project aims at producing a flexible and fast Python_
implementation.  The guiding idea is to translate a Python-level
description of the Python language itself to lower level languages.
Rumors have it that the secret goal is being faster-than-C which is
nonsense, isn't it?  `more...`_

The following is a list of planned PyPy events, most of which 
are also published in `iCalendar format`_.  See eventhistory_ 
for a list of past events.

Dynamic Languages Symposium (OOPSLA, 23rd October)
==================================================================

We will present a paper at the `Dynamic Languages Symposium`_ describing
`PyPy's approach to virtual machine construction`_.  The DLS is a
one-day forum within OOPSLA'06 (Portland, Oregon, USA).  The paper is a
motivated overview of the annotation/rtyping translation tool-chain,
with experimental results.

As usual, terminology with PyPy is delicate :-)  Indeed, the title is
both correct and misleading - it does not describe "the" PyPy virtual
machine, since we have never hand-written one.  This paper focuses on
how we are generating such VMs, not what they do.

Duesseldorf sprint #2, 30th October - 5th November
==================================================================

The next PyPy sprint will be held in Duesseldorf in Germany, where we
already met in June.  This is a "non-core-people" friendly sprint; we
will work on any topic of interest, be it from areas we are currently
focusing on (JIT, optimizations, py.test, build tools...) or from areas
that other people would like to consider (new back-ends, distribution,
security...).  Read the `full announcement`_ for more details.

Summer of PyPy: Calls for proposals open now! 
==================================================================

Happily, we are able to offer students mentoring and full sprint
participant's funding if we receive a proposal outlining an
interesting project related to PyPy and its development tools.  This
follows up on the "Summer of Code" campaign from Google but is
completely independent from it and also works differently. 
See the full call for details:

Ireland sprint 21st-27th August 
==================================================================

The last PyPy sprint happened in the nice city of 
Limerick in Ireland from 21st till 27th August.  
The main focus of the sprint was on JIT compiler works, 
various optimization works, porting extension modules, 
infrastructure works like a build tool for PyPy and
extended (distributed) testing. 
Read the full `announcement`_ for more details.

Release of PyPy video documentation
==================================================================

The PyPy team is happy to announce that the first bunch of PyPy videos
can now be downloaded from:

http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/video-index.html

The videos introduce involved people and contain different talks, tutorials and
interviews and can be downloaded via bittorrent. **29th June 2006**

PyPy 0.9.0
==================================================================

We are proud to release PyPy 0.9.0, our fourth public release.  See
the `release announcement <release-0.9.0.html>`__ to read about the
many new features in this release.

EuroPython PyPy sprint 6-9 July 2006
==================================================================

Once again a PyPy sprint will take place right after the EuroPython
Conference. This year it will be from the *6th to the 9th of July*.

Read more in `EuroPython sprint announcement`_, see who is  planning to attend
on `the people page`_. There is also a page_ in the python wiki.

PyPy at XP 2006 and Agile 2006
==================================================================

PyPy will present experience reports at the two main agile conferences
this year, `XP 2006`_ and `Agile 2006`_.
Both experience reports focus on aspects of the sprint-driven
development method that is being used in PyPy.

PyPy and Summer of Code 2006
==================================================================

PyPy will again mentor students through Google's `Summer of Code`_
campaign. Three students will kick-off their work on PyPy by
participating in the Duesseldorf sprint. They will be exploring a
back-end for Microsoft.NET, work on ways to build web applications
with Javascript code (in this case by translating RPython to
Javascript) and porting some CPython modules to use ctypes. Welcome to
the team!
