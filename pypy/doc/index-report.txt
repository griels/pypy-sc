PyPy - Overview over the EU-reports
============================================


We have written several reports for the EU of which some are also quite useful
as documentation. The ones not so useful as documentation mostly contain text
that can also be found in the regular documentation section. All of these
documents from the years 2006 and 2007 are preliminary versions, none of them
have been approved by the European Union. 

Reports of 2007
===============

`Interim D02.1 Development Tools and Website`_ is an interim version of a report
about the codespeak_ development environment and aditional tool support for the
PyPy development process. The report is still a
draft, all feedback for it is welcome. *(2007-03-12)*

`Interim D02.3 Testing Tool`_ is an interim version of a report about the
`py.test`_ testing tool which is part of the `py-lib`_. The report is still a
draft, all feedback for it is welcome. *(2007-03-12)*

`D07.1 Massive Parallelism and Translation Aspects`_ is a report about
PyPy's optimization efforts, garbage collectors and massive parallelism
(stackless) features.  This report refers to the paper `PyPy's approach
to virtual machine construction`_. *(2007-02-28)*

`D09.1 Constraint Solving and Semantic Web`_ is an interim version of a
report about PyPy's logic programming and constraint solving features, as well
as the work going on to tie semantic web technologies and PyPy together. All
feedback for it is welcome. *(2007-02-28)*

`D14.2 Tutorials and Guide Through the PyPy Source Code`_ is an interim version
of a report about the steps we have taken to make the project approachable for
newcomers.

`D03.1 Extension Compiler`_ is an interim version of a report about
PyPy's extension compiler and RCTypes, as well as the effort to keep up with
CPython's changes. All feedback for it is very welcome. *(2007-02-28)*

`Draft D13.1 Build and Configuration Tool`_ is an interim version of a report
about our build an configuration toolchain as well as the planned Debian
packages.  The report is still a draft, all feedback for it is welcome.
*(2007-02-02)*

`Draft D08.2 JIT Compiler Architecture`_ is an interim version of a report
about the Architecture and working of our JIT compiler generator.  The report
is still a draft, all feedback for it is welcome. *(2007-01-28)*

Reports of 2006
===============

`D14.3 Report about Milestone/Phase 2`_ is the final report about
the second phase of the EU project, summarizing and detailing technical, 
research, dissemination and community aspects.  Feedback is very welcome! 


Reports of 2005
===============

`D04.1 Partial Python Implementation`_ contains details about the 0.6 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D04.2 Complete Python Implementation`_ contains details about the 0.7 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D04.3 Parser and Bytecode Compiler`_ describes our parser and bytecode compiler.

`D04.4 PyPy as a Research Tool`_ contains details about the 0.8 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D05.1 Compiling Dynamic Language Implementations`_ is a paper that describes
the translation process, especially the flow object space and the annotator in
detail.

`D05.2 A Compiled Version of PyPy`_ contains more details about the 0.7 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D05.3 Implementation with Translation Aspects`_
describes how our approach hides away a lot of low level details.

`D05.4 Encapsulating Low Level Aspects`_ describes how we weave different
properties into our interpreter during the translation process.

`D14.1 Report about Milestone/Phase 1`_ describes what happened in the PyPy
project during the first year of EU funding (December 2004 - December 2005)
