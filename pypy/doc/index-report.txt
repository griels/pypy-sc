PyPy - Overview over the EU-reports
============================================


We have written several reports for the EU of which some are also quite useful
as documentation. The ones not so useful as documentation mostly contain text
that can also be found in the regular documentation section. All these
documents are not approved by the European Union and therefore only
preliminary.

Reports of 2006
===============

`D14.3 Report about Milestone/Phase 2`_ is the final report about
the second phase of the EU project, summarizing and detailing technical, 
research, dissemination and community aspects.  Feedback is very welcome! 

`Draft D07.1 Massive Parallelism and Translation Aspects`_ is a nearly finished
version of a report about PyPy's optimization efforts, garbage collectors and
massive parallelism (stackless) features. The report is basically done, however
we are still incorporating feedback.

`Draft D09.1 Constraint Solving and Semantic Web`_ is an interim version of a
report about PyPy's logic programming and constraint solving features, as well
as the work going on to tie semantic web technologies and PyPy together. The
report is still a draft, all feedback for it is welcome.


Reports of 2005
===============

`D04.1 Partial Python Implementation`_ contains details about the 0.6 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D04.2 Complete Python Implementation`_ contains details about the 0.7 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D04.3 Parser and Bytecode Compiler`_ describes our parser and bytecode compiler.

`D04.4 PyPy as a Research Tool`_ contains details about the 0.8 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D05.1 Compiling Dynamic Language Implementations`_ is a paper that describes
the translation process, especially the flow object space and the annotator in
detail.

`D05.2 A Compiled Version of PyPy`_ contains more details about the 0.7 release.
All the content can be found in the regular documentation section.

`D05.3 Implementation with Translation Aspects`_
describes how our approach hides away a lot of low level details.

`D05.4 Encapsulating Low Level Aspects`_ describes how we weave different
properties into our interpreter during the translation process.

`D14.1 Report about Milestone/Phase 1`_ describes what happened in the PyPy
project during the first year of EU funding (December 2004 - December 2005)
