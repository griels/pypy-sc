How fast is PyPy?

    As of August 2005, PyPy was succesfully translated to C.
    The version of PyPy that still runs on top of CPython
    is slower by a factor of 2000 compared to CPython. The translated
    versions seems to be roughly 300 times slower than CPython.
    On the other hand, the really interesting question is: Why is
    PyPy so slow?


 Why is PyPy so slow?

    Our translation process does not optimize the produced code very
    much yet. Just one example: if you use a ``for i in range(x)`` loop
    the loop will be ended by raising an exception (although the ``range``
    list will not be created in its entirety).
