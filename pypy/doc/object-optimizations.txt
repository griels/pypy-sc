===================================================================
Alternative object implementations in the PyPy standard interpreter
===================================================================

One of the advantages of the PyPy standard interpreter (compared to CPython) is
that we can provide several implementations of the same object (e.g. for lists
and strings) without the user noticing any difference. This makes it easy to
provide a specialized implementation of a type that is optimized for a certain
situation without disturbing the implementation for the regular case.

We have implemented several such optimizations. Most of them are not enabled by
default. Also, it is not clear for all there optimizations whether they are
worth it in practice, for a real-world application (they sure make some
microbenchmarks a lot faster of use less memory, which is not saying too much).
If you have any observation in that direction, please let us know! By the way:
alternative object implementations are a great way to get into PyPy development
since you have to know only a rather small part of PyPy to do them. And they are
fun too!


String optimizations
====================

string-join objects
-------------------

String-join objects are a different implementation of the Python ``str`` type,
They represent the lazy addition of several strings without actually performing
the addition (which involves copying etc.). When the actual value of the string
join object is needed, the addition is performed. This makes it possible to
perform repeated string additions in a loop without using the
``"".join(list_of_strings)`` pattern.

string-slice objects
--------------------

String-slice objects are another implementation of the Python ``str`` type.
They represent the lazy slicing of a string without actually performing the
slicing (which would involve copying). This is only done for slices of step
one. When the actual value of the string slice object is needed, the slicing
is done (although a lot of string methods don't make this necessary). This
makes string slicing a very efficient operation. It also saves memory in some
cases but can also lead to memory leaks, since the string slice retains a
reference to the original string (to make this a bit less likely, the slicing
is only done when the length of the slice exceeds a certain number of characters
and when the slice length is a significant amount of the original string's
length).

Integer optimizations
=====================

caching small integers
----------------------

Similar to what CPython does it is possible to enable caching of small integer
objects to not have to allocate all the time when doing simple arithmetic. Every
time a new integer object is created it is checked whether the integer is small
enough to be retrieved from the cache.


integers as tagged pointers
---------------------------

An even more aggressive way to save memory when using integers is "small int"
integer implementation. It is another integer implementation used for integers
that only need 31 bits (respective 63 bits on an 64 bit machine). These integers
are represented as tagged pointers by setting their lowest bits to distinguish
them from normal pointers. This makes boxing of these integers use no memory at
all.


Dictionary optimizations
========================

string-keyed dictionaries
-------------------------

String-keyed dictionaries are an alternate implmentation of the ``dict`` type.
These dictionaries are optimized for string keys, which is obviously a big win
for all but the most contrived Python programs. As soon as one non-string key
is stored in the dict
the whole information in the string-keyed dictionary is copied over into another
RPython-dictionary, where arbitrary Python objects can be used as keys.

multi-dicts
-----------

Multi-dicts are another special implementation of dictionaries. While
implementing the string-keyed dictionaries it became clear that it is very
useful to *change* the internal representation of an object during its lifetime.
String-keyed dictionaries already do that in a limited way (changing the
representation from a string-to-object mapping to an object-to-object mapping).
Multi-Dicts are way more general in providing support for this switching of
representations for dicts in a rather general way.

If you just enable multi-dicts, special representations for empty dictionaries,
for string-keyed dictionaries and for small dictionaries are used (as well as a
general representation that can store arbitrary keys). In addition there are
more specialized dictionary implementations for various purposes (see below).


sharing dicts
-------------

Sharing dictionaries are a special representation used together with multidicts.
This dict representation is used only for instance dictionaries and tries to
make instance dictionaries use less memory (in fact, in the ideal case the
memory behaviour should be mostly like that of using __slots__).

The idea is the following: Most instances of the same class have very similar
attributes, and are even adding these keys to the dictionary in the same order
while ``__init__`` is being executed. That means that all the dictionaries of
these instances look very similar: they have the same set of keys with different
values per instance. What sharing dicts do is store these common keys into a
common structure object and thus safe the space in the individual instance dict:
the representation of the instance dict contains only a list of values.


builtin-shadowing
-----------------

Usually the calling of builtins in Python requires two dictionary lookups: first
to see whether the current global dictionary contains an object with the same
name, then a lookup in the ``__builtin__`` dictionary. This is somehow
circumvented by storing an often used builtin into a local variable to get
the fast local lookup (which is a rather strange and ugly hack).

The same problem is solved in a different way by "wary" dictionaries. They are
another dictionary representation used together with multidicts. This
representation is used only for module dictionaries. The repesentation checks on
every setitem whether the key that is used is the name of a builtin. If this is
the case, the dictionary is marked as shadowing that particular builtin.

To identify calls to builtins easily, a new bytecode (``CALL_LIKELY_BUILTIN``)
is introduced. Whenever it is executed, the globals dictionary is checked
whether it masks the builtin (which is possible without a dictionary lookup).
Then the ``__builtin__`` dict is checked whether somebody replaced the real
builtin with something else in the same way. If both these conditions are not
met, the proper builtin is called, using no dictionary lookup at all.

List optimizations
==================

range-lists
-----------

Range-lists solve the same problem that the ``xrange`` builtin solves poorly:
the problem that ``range`` allocates memory even if the resulting list is only
ever used for iterating over it. Range lists are a different implementation for
lists. They are created only as a result of a call to ``range``. As long as the
resulting list is used without being mutated, the list stores only start, stop
and step of the range. Only when somebody mutates the list the actual list is
created. This gives the memory and speed behaviour of ``xrange`` and the general
of use of ``range``.


multi-lists
-----------

As with dictionaries it became clear that it is generally useful to allow lists
to change their internal representation over their lifetime. Therefore
multi-lists were implemented, mostly equivalently to multi-dicts. The special
representations you get by default are for empty lists, for lists containing
only strings and ranges again (the reason why range lists and multilists both
implement the same optimization is that range lists came earlier and that
multi-lists are not tried that much so far).


fast list slicing
------------------

A rather experimental special list representation used with multilists is the
slice list (the original idea is from `Neal Norwitz on pypy-dev`_). The
observation is that slices are often created for iterating over them, so it
seems wasteful to create a full copy of that portion of the list. Instead the
list slice is only created lazily, that is when the original list or the sliced
list are mutated.

User class optimizations
========================

Shadow tracking
---------------

Shadow tracking is a general optimization that speeds up method calls for user
classes (that don't have special meta-class). For this a special dict
representation is used together with multidicts. This dict representation is
used only for instance dictionaries. The instance dictionary tracks whether an
instance attribute shadows an attribute of its class. This makes method calls
slightly faster in the following way: When calling a method the first thing that
is checked is the class dictionary to find descriptors. Normally, when a method
is found, the instance dictionary is then checked for instance attributes
shadowing the class attribute. If we know that there is no shadowing (since
instance dict tells us that) we can save this lookup on the instance dictionary.


Method caching
--------------

Shadow tracking is also an important building block for the method caching
optimization. A method cache is introduced where the result of a method lookup
is stored (which involves potentially many lookups in the base classes of a
class). Entries in the method cache are stored using a hash consisting of the
hash of the name being looked up, the call site (e.g. the bytecode object and
the currend program counter) and a special "version" of the type where the
lookup happens (that version is incremented every time the type or one of its
base classes is changed). On subsequent lookups the cached version can be used
(at least if the instance did not shadow any of its classes attributes).
