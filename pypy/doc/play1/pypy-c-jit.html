The PyPy standard interpreter compiled to C with the mysterious JIT.
JIT can now speedup very much simple arithmetic operations.
Paste this example (<a href="javascript:execute_snippet('pypy-c-jit', 0)">paste</a>) for simple function:
<pre>%s</pre>
Try running it (test_f1()) and try running <i>pypyjit.enable(f1.func_code)</i> and watch the difference.
