Few ctypes-related todo points:

* Write down missing parts and port all tests, eventually adding
  additional tests.

  - for unions and structs, late assignement of _fields_ is somewhat buggy.
    Tests about behavior of getattr working properly on instances
    are missing or not comprehensive. Some tests are skipped because I didn't
    understand the details.

  - restype being a function is not working.

  - there are features, which we don't support like buffer() and
    array() protocols.

  - raw structure/arrays as function arguments/result types are not supported
    (even on _rawffi level)

  - bitfields are not implemented

  - byteorder is not implemented

* as all stuff is applevel, we cannot have it really fast right now.

* we shall at least try to approach ctypes from the point of the jit
  backends (at least on platforms that we support). The thing is that
  we need a lot broader support of jit backends for different argument
  passing in order to do it.
