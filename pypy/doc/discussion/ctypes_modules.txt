Few words what we need for ctypes-based pygame and how feasible it is
=====================================================================

Quick recap for module evaluation:

1. do we need callbacks?

2. how sophisticated ctypes usage is (accessing of _objects?)

3. any specific tricks

4. does it has tests?

5. dependencies

6. does it depend on cpython c-api over ctypes?
