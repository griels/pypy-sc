Some discussion about external objects in ootype
================================================

Current approaches:

* BasicExternal, used for js backend

* SomeCliXxx for .NET backend

BasicExternal
=============

* Is using types to make rpython happy (ie, every single method or field
  is hardcoded)

* Supports callbacks by SomeGenericCallable

* Supports fields, also with callable fields

SomeCliXxx
==========

* Supports method overloading

* Supports inheritance in a better way

* Supports static methods

Would be extremely cool to have just one approach instead of two,
so here are some notes:

* There should be one mechanism, factored out nicely out of any backend,
  to support any possible backend (cli, js, jvm for now).

* This approach might be eventually extended by a backend itself, but
  as much as possible code should be factored out.

* Backend should take care itself about creating such classes, either
  manually or automatically.

* Should support superset of needs of all backends (ie callbacks,
  method overloading, etc.)
