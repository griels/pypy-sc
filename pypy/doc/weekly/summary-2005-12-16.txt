=======================
  This Week in PyPy 7
=======================

Introduction
============

This is the seventh summary of what's been going on in the world of
PyPy in the last week.  I'd still like to remind people that when
something worth summarizing happens to recommend if for "This Week in
PyPy" as mentioned on:

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/weekly/

where you can also find old summaries.

There were about 110 commits to the pypy section of codespeak's
repository in the last week.


The Sprint!
===========

The last weekly summary was written towards then end of the sprint.
The things we did in the couple of remaining days were written up in
the second sprint report:

    http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2005q4/002660.html

Apart from continuing our work from the first half of the sprint, the
main new work was implementing __del__ support in the translated PyPy.


IRC Summary
===========

Thanks again to Pieter for this.

**Monday** http://tismerysoft.de/pypy/irc-logs/pypy/%23pypy.log.20051212::

 [00:26] Stakkars says that it is great that pypy does not punish you for
         indirection. He is of meaning that he writes better style in RPython
         than in Python, because the "it is slow" aspect is gone.

**Tuesday** http://tismerysoft.de/pypy/irc-logs/pypy/%23pypy.log.20051213::

 [21:01] Heatsink says that he is doing some dynamic optimizations in CPython.
         This turns into a discussion about the nature of pypy, and Arigo takes
         us on a tour of how pypy and the JIT will interact in the future. A
         good read of general pypy ideas.
 
**Thursday** http://tismerysoft.de/pypy/irc-logs/pypy/%23pypy.log.20051215::

 [10:24] Ericvrp discovers an optimization that makes pypy 6.8x slower than
         CPython on the richards test suite. All if-elses are converted to
         switches. Cfbolz replies that it is time to write a graph
         transformation to implement this optimization officially.
