  Spent some time trying to have "pypy-c py.py" work.  We are still left in
  the dark of incomprehensible geninterplevel crashes caused by subtle
  differences between the most internal types of CPython and pypy-c, like
  <type 'method-wrapper'> (10 bonus points to anyone who knows that this
  is).

  Fun with targetmultiplespaces -- problems specializing space.wrap
  when it's not effectively a global function due to the constant-ness
  of the 'space'.
