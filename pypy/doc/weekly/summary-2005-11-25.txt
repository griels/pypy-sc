=======================
  This Week in PyPy 4
=======================

Introduction
============

This is the fourth of what will hopefully be many summaries of what's
been going on in the world of PyPy in the last week.  I'd still like
to remind people that when something worth summarizing happens to
recommend if for "This Week in PyPy" as mentioned on:

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/weekly/

where you can also find old summaries.

There were about 50 commits to the pypy section of codespeak's
repository since the last summary (not quite a week).


SomePBC-refactoring
===================

We attacked the RTyper quite a lot.


LLVM progress
=============

Richard (nearly?) implemented threading in the LLVM backend.


Sprint preparation
==================

Göteborg approaches.


PyPy spreads
============

Christian consulted in America.


Whither pypy-sync meetings?
===========================

The weekly pypy-sync meeting singularly failed to happen this week.


Resource consumption
====================

As part of being EU-funded, we have to keep track of the resources we use
and have a slightly unusual problem: we haven't spent enough time or
money in the first half of the project, and have to find something to
do about this...


PyPy at conferences
===================

All three talks on PyPy that we submitted to PyCon were accepted, so
there will be talks from 

 - Michael and Christian on the current state of PyPy (whatever that
   may be at the time :),

 - Holger and Armin on the architecture and future of PyPy, and 

 - Bea and Holger on the methodology of PyPy and the issues around
   being EU funded.

Further to that, two papers were accepted for the Chaos Communication
Congress in Berlin over the new year were accepted:

   http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/585.en.html
   http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/events/586.en.html

Again, one talk is on the technology of PyPy and the other on
methodology/business issues.

So if you're going to a Python or hacker conference any time soon,
you're likely to hear about PyPy :)
