"This week in PyPy" stuff
-------------------------

I (mwh) am going to write a summary of what's been happening in
pypy-land each week.  To help me along, please add (append) things
worth mentioning to the file ``log`` in this directory.

To be most helpful, please say who you are, roughly when you're adding
things and mention where in the #pypy logs relavent discussion can be
found.  For example::

    2005-10-27  mwh

      I decided to write "This week in PyPy" each week!  See 
      http://tismerysoft.de/pypy/irc-logs/pypy/%23pypy.log.20051027
      around 13:30 server time.

Once a week (probably after the Thursday lunchtime pypy-sync meeting)
I'll run through the file, write up the the best bits, send that to
pypy-dev, copy the log file to log.YEAR-MONTH-DAY and make a new one.

Thanks in advance!
