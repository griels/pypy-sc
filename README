PyPy: Python in Python implementation / Version 0.7.0
=======================================================

Welcome to PyPy!   PyPy-0.7.0 marks the first public release 
that allows to build a self-contained Python implementation
that does not depend or run on top of CPython anymore.  

We invested a lot of time in improving the documentation and
website and thus invite you to head over to our getting-started
document 

    pypy/doc/getting-started.txt  (local if you got a tarball)

    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html 

which gives you many good starting and entry points into
playing with PyPy.  It will also point you to our
documentation section which is generated from information
in the pypy/doc directory. 

Our online release announcement has some more  
information about the specific PyPy-0.7.0 release: 

    pypy/documentation/release-0.7.0.txt or 
    http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/release-0.7.0.html 

Please note that the last 9 months of PyPy development 
have been funded by the European Union through its research
programme. 

Enjoy and send us feedback! 

    the pypy-dev team <pypy-dev@codespeak.net>
